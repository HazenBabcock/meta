# Reducing duplicated effort when controlling microscope hardware with python

There are a growing number of groups using python to control microscope hardware. To date, people have largely been
operating in their own silos, leading to a large amount of duplicated effort. We would like to minimize this going forwards,
and to provide a way of co-ordinating efforts.

This repository exists to facilitate an open discussion about a) what exactly we are trying to achieve and 
b) how best to achieve it. Discussion is based in the repository issues, and is open to all. **If you use python to drive
your microscope or if you want to do so in the future, we want you involved.** Please comment on the issues 
(or create a new one) if you have anything to add.

Longer term aspirations range from, on the most basic level, a catalogue of current microscopy related hardware code so
that you can rapidly find out if someone has already have a python wrapper for your hardware, through to providing a unified 
api for common hardware types and large repository of drivers.
